# Example Code For *Test-Driven Development with Python*

Test is important, even though we programmers have tests for our code, but there are still production bugs. In shopee we have professional QA teams, a lot bugs will be discovered and fixed before deploying to production. In Tencent(esp our team) we dont have QA, even product managager, thus programers always introduce bugs into production. how can we make sure the code change is correct? how many tests is enough?

I guess the answer is `TDD`, this repo is the source code of a to-do list app with tests, i.e practice of TDD.
